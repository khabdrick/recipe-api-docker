# Steps to Deploy FastAPI with Docker

This guide provides detailed steps to containerize and deploy a FastAPI application using Docker and Docker Compose. It includes project setup, application development, Docker configuration, database setup, HTTPS implementation, and deployment testing.

### Project Setup
[ ] Create project directory structure with separate folders for app code, database configs, and Docker files  
[ ] Set up Python virtual environment and install dependencies (FastAPI, asyncpg/SQLAlchemy, uvicorn)  
[ ] Create requirements.txt file  

### Application Development
[ ] Build async FastAPI application with database connection pooling  
[ ] Configure async database models and connection settings  
[ ] Set up environment variables for database credentials and app configuration  
[ ] Create database migration scripts or initialization files  

### Docker Configuration
[ ] Write Dockerfile for FastAPI application (multi-stage build recommended)  
[ ] Create docker-compose.yml with services for FastAPI app and PostgreSQL  
[ ] Configure PostgreSQL service with persistent volumes and environment variables  
[ ] Set up networking between containers  

### Database Setup
[ ] Create database initialization scripts  
[ ] Set up database connection retry logic in the application  
[ ] Configure database connection pooling for async operations  

### HTTPS Implementation
[ ] Obtain SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt, self-signed, or commercial)  
[ ] Add reverse proxy service (Nginx or Traefik) to docker-compose.yml  
[ ] Configure reverse proxy for SSL termination and forwarding to FastAPI  
[ ] Set up certificate renewal automation (if using Let's Encrypt)  
[ ] Configure security headers and HTTPS redirects  

### Deployment & Testing
[ ] Build and run containers using docker-compose  
[ ] Test database connectivity and async operations  
[ ] Verify HTTPS configuration and certificate validity  
[ ] Test application endpoints through HTTPS
